The Sudoku Game FOCP Assignment 2:

## Title and Team Information:
**Project Title:** Sudoku Game   

**Team Information: CMS IDs and Roles:**  
  - Summiya Aurangzeb (546507)  
  - Sarah Shahid (546132)  
  - Zoha Ahsan (545764)

  **Summiya Aurangzeb:**  
                 

  **Sarah Shahid:**  
                 

                 
  **Zoha Ahsan:**  
  Managed Readme on GIT and added her functions in the code.
                  
## Problem Description and Overview:
Some games are not played merely for entertainment, but they sharpen and enhance the critical thinking of mind. Sudoku is the most popular among such games. Research shows that playing such games not only sharpens the mind but also increases the memory. The player has to make a strategy and think of a solution just as the programmers do while writing algorithms.  
**What makes it interesting:**  
We made our own functions and experimented with our logics to make the final game. Creating the game is equally interesting as playing the game. We had to make multiple versions before concluding the final version so it helped alot in building concepts and problem solving. This assignment also highlighted the importance and benefits of team work.
  
## Program Design and Logic:  
**Functions overview** :  
The functions used in the code are:
**- void printBoard()** This function prints the whole sudokuboard in a formatted way. 
**- bool isvalid()** It checks if the entry is valid according to the sudoku rules.
**- void initialboard()** It generates a valid sudokuboard and then generates a partially filled version of it to start the game.
**- int userEntry()** It lets the user choose the row and column number and then takes an input if it is valid.

## Execution Instructions:  

## Team Collaboration Summary:  
**Division of Roles:**  


**(1)** Summiya Aurangzeb:  

 
  
**(2)** Sarah Shahid:  
- Created a public repository with name: Sarah-Summiya-Zoha_SudokuGame.
- Added the team members as collaborators.
- Created Readme file and made the first commit on it.

**(3)** Zoha Ahsan:  
- Accepted the invitation to get added as a collaborator on the repository.
- Managed the Readme on GIT.
- Used Sarah's logic to create printboard function.
- Created the userEntry function.

## Usage of AI and Reflection:
- used gpt to understand about the markdown in git readme file. (its specific syntax) It told us about the basic  markdown syntax.


## Future Improvements:  
The game can be made better in future by adding more advanced features and increase user interaction. New concepts like data structures (arrays, vectors) could make the game more flexible. Object-oriented programming can give an organized board and gameplay.
